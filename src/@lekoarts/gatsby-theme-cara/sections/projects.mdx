  If you use Google Chrome Translator to translate the entire site, texts from right-to-left languages such as Persian and Arabic are incorrect because they are still left-to-right, only translated.
  This plugin solves the problem.
  Before translating the English site into Persian or Arabic
  Click on our plugin then the "fix" badge will be displayed. Now translate the whole site and you will see that the translation quality has improved and the words and verbs are in the right place.
